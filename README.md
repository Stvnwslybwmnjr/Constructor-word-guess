# Constructor-word-guess

A command Line Interface Word Game where you are shown a number of blank spaces representing letters in this word. Use Keystrokes to enter your guess and if you are correct the space will be replaced with that letter. Watch out though only a certain number of guesses is permitted then its GAME OVER! Good Luck and Have Fun!
